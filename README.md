# DATA2001

I completed a series of assignments as part of my DATA2001 course, where I gained valuable insights into data science methodologies. Each assignment provided practical experience and focused on different aspects of data analysis.

In Assignment 1, I worked with a structured penguin dataset, learning how to analyze and interpret data effectively. Through tasks such as data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and applying clustering and principal component analysis techniques, I developed skills in data manipulation, visualization, and pattern recognition.

Assignment 2 involved working with an unstructured dataset of Amazon fine foods reviews. This assignment taught me the importance of data preparation, including text cleaning and annotation. I built a logistic regression text classifier to categorize sentiment and evaluated its performance, comparing it with a baseline model. Through this assignment, I gained expertise in text analysis, model building, and evaluation.

In Assignment 3, I delved into time series analysis using US stock trading data for Amazon. By focusing on data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and decomposition analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of time series patterns and trends. I applied ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast stock volumes and compared the results with pure forecasting methods. This assignment enhanced my knowledge of time series forecasting and evaluation.

Through these assignments, I acquired practical skills in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and forecasting. I also learned the importance of effective data preparation, visualization techniques, and model evaluation. These experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of data analysis methodologies and their applications in real-world scenarios.
